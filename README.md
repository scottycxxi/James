This is the initial set of files built to test memory of the verses in the book of James
It may be altered later to include more of the bible, it may not be

To do
don't show any score on 100% help round
when showing misses, set some character length so lines don't wrap
have different ----> design for a started guess and the grading box
count guesses and answers better based on game mode (shouldn't score for typing a given word) 
save misses for another try after the end (this will take a game mode update)
take out post verse context

long term
store scores long term
keep score on rounds with no help
save progress mid run

hardmode random retest shouldnt add context

fuller score at the end, like how many cycles (how many missed verses?/overall word percentage)

check if guess is too long if it breaks
